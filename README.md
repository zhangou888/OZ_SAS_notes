# OZ_SAS_notes
 
# This repo contains my 2017 SAS study notes and white paper collections I think most useful for my sas programming. 
Story behind this repo:

I am not a pure SAS user, but my former jobs (Psychometrics and Assessmentï¼‰ required me to be efficient in SAS. 
So, I decided beef up my SAS programming skills in the 2017.
I spent a lot time on reading SAS tech white paper, refactoring legacy codes so that it becomes more readable and shorter.

The Key programming thought are included in my 2018 talk-"Writing readable codes"

Since I move to different industry, I no longer code in SAS very often. Instead, I usually program in R or Python. 
But a couple of weeks ago, one of my old friends asked me a SAS trick question, I was glad I can still give her some hints. 

So, I decide to create this repo and hope the materials and contents I collected may help anyone in SAS programming, at least, to some extent.

The folder contains 8 subfolders:

1. Efficiency (most useful paper collections for sas programming efficiency).
2. macro (2nd most usefulll paper collections for SAS macro basic definition and rules)
3. data steps
4. debug
5. hash
6. comment (different SAS comment styles and how to properly comment sas code)
7. create date
8. code (3 sets of SAS code I think are useful).
